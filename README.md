# Getting started with Node Webkit

This is a template project for Node Webkit using the following frameworks:

- Jade (HTML preprocessor)
- Compass (CSS preprocessor)
- Grunt (build system)

## No Node-Express server (yet)

Currently I don't have a need for Node Express (yet).

That is why I use the Grunt build system to compile Jade and SCSS files.

## Installation

`npm install`

## Build

`grunt`

## Starting the application

Arch Linux (with globally installed `nw` command):

`nw dist-pkg/releases/my-app/linux64/my-app/my-app`
